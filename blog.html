            The first assignment was quite easy for me because I am already familiar with HTML, CSS and a little less JavaScript.
            I used a little CSS for the image and description display (to center them).
            My blog is currently not very beautiful but it was just to have an idea of how it will look like later.
            I used some websites such as W3School because I didn't remember some things in CSS (just to remember the methods of placing objects)

            This assignment was more complicated than the first one because css has many arguments and we have to deal with div parenting issues. 
            I had some problems because I had started to layout the website so that when the page shrinks, the elements shrink too. 
            And I realized afterwards that this was not the case but that the products were going under each other.
            I already knew some of the css arguments and this assignment helped me remember what I had done in the past. 
            It also allowed me (through the way the assignment was done) to be more comfortable with the inspector and to be able to go faster when coding the layout.
            I mainly used the course and the examples provided in the course, 
            and I used the internet for specific questions (for example, I couldn't remember how to underline a text).

            This assignment was more complicated than the first two in the sense that the elements to do were more abstract.
            I had to spend some time writing on paper the method I was going to use to create a new object for example.

            I already knew how to get html elements from js and how to modify them so the filter was quite easy but I had never used firstchild...
            ( I had used innerhtml at the time ) so it was interesting to see a new more secure method

            I used the courses you gave and I inquired on the internet for small specific things where I did not want to spend too much time (for example: how to delete the text of an input) because it corresponded to a line of code.
            Otherwise I rather experimented to see for myself.

            This assignment was challenging because I knew how local servers worked but I didn't know how it worked for connected web pages.
            I learned many things about the client/server relationship and how to respond to a request from the client.
            For this assignment, I used mainly the code and the explanations given in class. I used the internet to expand my understanding of the course.
            The things I could see on Google were specific problems that I couldn't understand by myself and where I needed more explanations so I wouldn't get stuck for hours on end.

            This assignment was quite challenging for me but really interesting.
             It was the first time I was involved in a html template project and I found it very instructive to avoid code repetition but also to reuse the code and to get a better overview of our project.
            The most challenging part of this assignment was to make the index.html template.
             I didn't have any particular difficulty and I didn't do a lot of internet research because the course was clear enough for me.
             The only thing I looked for on the internet was to better understand how it works but also because I had a problem on safari and I
              understood on forums that I had to use another search engine to load handlebars from the link ( src ....link..... \src)
